\section{Motivation}

When the internet was first established, everything sent over it was public. If A sent a message to B, anyone on their path through the internet could see that such a message was sent, as well as read the actual message. As of today, many messaging services are end-to-end encrypted, meaning that no one can read the contents of messages. However, for sufficiently powerful adversaries — hackers, ISPs, government agencies — it is still possible to find out who is talking to whom, as well as when and how often messages are sent. Our goal is to hide this metadata: we want to create a system where A and B can send messages to each other over an untrusted network, without anyone knowing that they talk to each other. Such a private communication system would be critically important to protect and expand freedom in the world \cite{arvid}.
