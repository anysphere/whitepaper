\todo{Explain why Signal is not enough. Good table.}

In this section, we describe what our system achieves beyond end-to-end encrypted messaging applications like Signal and Wickr.

Signal is great. It is end-to-end encrypted, open source, and run by a trustworthy group. Unfortunately, if their servers are hacked, one of their employees bribed, or you are simply attacked by a network-level powerful actor, there is nothing Signal can guarantee.

Furthermore, even with a secure server, it leaks metadata. Using timing attacks, an adversary can figure out when, where and with whom you are talking.
