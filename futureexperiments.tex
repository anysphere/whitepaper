\section{What's Next?}\label{sec:future}

Private communication is a hard problem. We are actively doing research to increase convenience while preserving complete privacy. We also urge the research community to join us: during the first practical deployment of metadata-private communication, we have found that while many papers focus on the scalability of a core one-person messaging protocol, too few focus on problems that come up in practice, including private trust establishment, multiple-friend management, one-to-many and many-to-many communcation, and DoS protection.

% Anysphere has just begun operations, and we are devoted to truly free communication. 
% We aim to supervise and help build technologies that allow internet communication without unfair security assumptions.
% There are several important milestones that we have set for ourselves to reach to make this genuinely possible; some that are essential in the short-term and others that we want to achieve over a longer time horizon with time and effort.

\subsection{Implementation milestones}


\subsubsection{Small Files and images.} We hope to support the transmission of small files and images through our current protocol. 

\subsubsection{Forward secrecy.} We hope to integrate Signal's X3DH algorithm to ensure forward secrecy. 

\subsubsection{Public-key infrastructure.} To facilitate the discovery and .

\subsubsection{Calls.}

\subsubsection{Hardened daemon against local malware.}

\subsection{Research problems}

\subsubsection{Denial of service resistance.}

\subsubsection{One-to-many and many-to-many conversations.} An essentially important problem to solve is to allow groups of people to broadcast messages to each other, without depending on the presense of any specific user. We understand that this brings risks in itself to users because it increases the overall risk surface that a user has to trust but we believe it is crucial for large-scale pragmatic adoption.

\subsubsection{More efficient trust establishment.}

\subsubsection{The ACK problem.}

\subsubsection{The multiple friends problem.}

\subsubsection{Large Files and images.} Transmission of larger files and images is infeasible in our current framework because the number of chunks needed to deliver them is in the thousands; we will tackle that problem separately later.
