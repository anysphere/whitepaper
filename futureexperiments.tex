\section{What's Next?}

Anysphere has just begun operations, and we are devoted to truly free communication. 
We aim to supervise and help build technologies that allow internet communication without unfair security assumptions.
There are several important milestones that we have set for ourselves to reach to make this genuinely possible; some that are essential in the short-term and others that we want to achieve over a longer time horizon with time and effort.

\subsection{Short term milestones}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Group-chats through broadcasting}: An essentially important problem to solve is to allow groups of people to broadcast messages to each other, without depending on the presense of any specific user. We understand that this brings risks in itself to users because it increases the overall risk surface that a user has to trust but we believe it is crucial for large-scale pragmatic adoption.

  \item \textbf{Files and Images}: We hope to allow the sending of small files and images, through our current protocol. Larger files and images are tricky because they expload in the number of chunks needed to deliver them, but we will tackle that problem in due-time.

  \item \textbf{Denial of Service Protection}:

  \item \textbf{Forward Secrecy}

  \item \textbf{Public Key Infrastructure for Anysphere}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Long-term milestones}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Calls}

  \item \textbf{}
\end{itemize}
