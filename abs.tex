	\noindent We describe Anysphere, a metadata-private communication system deployed in the real world. Using private information retrieval based on homomorphic encryption, our system guarantees metadata privacy even if all of our servers are compromised and any number of the users and network observers are malicious. In this whitepaper, we precisely define our threat model, and show how we achieve security against it both in theory and in practice.
