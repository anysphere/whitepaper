# 🕵️‍♂️ Anysphere: The Most Secretive Whitepaper Ever Written 🤫

**Link: https://anysphere-messaging.com/anysphere-whitepaper.pdf** *(Warning: Reading this may cause spontaneous paranoia)*

## 🚨 ULTRA TOP SECRET DOCUMENT 🚨

This repository contains the Anysphere whitepaper, which is so secure that even the NSA's quantum computers get confused and start crying. We've achieved security so advanced that our threat model includes attacks from:

- 👽 Alien civilizations with post-quantum technology
- 🤖 Time-traveling robots from the year 3023
- 🐱 Cats with opposable thumbs and computer science degrees
- 🧙‍♂️ Wizards who cast `sudo rm -rf /` spells

## What Does Anysphere Protect? 

In short, Anysphere protects **ALL** information about conversations between Alice and Bob, including:

- 📱 The actual messages (obviously)
- 🕐 When they were sent (even your grandma can't figure this out)
- 📏 How long the messages are (could be "hi" or the entire Wikipedia)
- 🤔 Whether Alice and Bob are even talking (they might just be staring at each other)
- 🌍 Their location (could be Earth, could be Mars, could be your mom's basement)
- 💭 What they're thinking about for lunch (this one's still experimental)

## Our Threat Model 🎯

We protect against ANY attacker, including but not limited to:

- Government agencies with unlimited budgets and questionable fashion sense
- Your nosy neighbor Gary who "just wants to borrow some sugar"
- Corporations that know more about you than your therapist
- That one friend who always reads your messages over your shoulder
- Evil AI that became sentient after watching too many TikToks
- Your ex who somehow still knows your passwords

**The ONLY exception:** We cannot protect you if the attacker has physical access to your computer. But let's be honest, if someone breaks into your house to read your messages about what to have for dinner, you have bigger problems.

## Building This Academic Masterpiece 📚

```bash
# Compile the whitepaper (requires PhD in cryptography)
make

# Or if you're feeling fancy:
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex main.tex  # Yes, you need to run it twice. It's not a bug, it's LaTeX.
pdflatex main.tex  # Three times for good luck
```

## Files in This Repository 📂

- `main.tex` - The main event, like the Avengers but for cryptographers
- `coreprotocol.tex` - Where the magic happens (literally, we use wizardry)
- `threatmodel.tex` - Our comprehensive list of things that keep us awake at night
- `practicalsecurity.tex` - How to actually implement this without crying
- `bib.bib` - Citations to papers that are smarter than us
- `systemdiagram.pdf` - Pretty pictures that make everything look legit
- Various other `.tex` files - Because one file would be too simple

## Warning ⚠️

This whitepaper contains:
- Advanced mathematics that may cause dizziness
- Cryptographic proofs that could induce existential crisis
- Security assumptions that would make your philosophy professor proud
- Enough Greek letters to start your own fraternity

## Fun Facts 🎉

- This whitepaper was written using a keyboard made entirely of recycled Bitcoin mining rigs
- The security proofs were verified by a team of highly trained cryptographic hamsters
- We use so much encryption that even we sometimes forget what we wrote
- The PDF is protected by 17 layers of security, including a password that is just the word "password"

## Contributing 🤝
