# Whitepaper

**Link: https://anysphere-messaging.com/anysphere-whitepaper.pdf**

The Anysphere whitepaper describes our exact threat model and how we achieve security against threats in the model.

In short, Anysphere protects all information about a conversation between A and B, against any attacker, as long as the attacker does not have access to A's or B's computers.

## Abstract Joke 🤓

Why did the abstract class break up with the concrete class?

Because the concrete class kept trying to instantiate their relationship, but the abstract class said "I can't be created directly - you need to inherit from me first!"
