# Whitepaper

The Anysphere whitepaper describes our exact threat model and how we achieve security against threats in the model.

In short, Anysphere protects all information about a conversation between A and B, against any attacker, as long as the attacker does not have access to A's or B's computers.

## A Little Humor 😄

Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs! 🐛

*But don't worry, our security model is thoroughly debugged.*
