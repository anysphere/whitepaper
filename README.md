The Anysphere whitepaper describes our exact threat model and how we achieve security against threats in the model.

In short, Anysphere protects all information about a conversation between A and B, against any attacker, as long as the attacker does not have access to A's or B's computers.

## A Little Humor

Why don't attackers like quantum computers?

Because they can never be sure if they're *really* breaking the encryption or just superpositioned into thinking they are! 🔐
