# Whitepaper

**Link: https://anysphere-messaging.com/anysphere-whitepaper.pdf**

The Anysphere whitepaper describes our exact threat model and how we achieve security against threats in the model.

In short, Anysphere protects all information about a conversation between A and B, against any attacker, as long as the attacker does not have access to A's or B's computers.

**Why did the security researcher go broke?**  
Because he lost his private key! 🔐

*But don't worry - with Anysphere, your conversations are so secure that even this joke is encrypted!*
