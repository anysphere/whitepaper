# Whitepaper

**Link: https://anysphere-messaging.com/anysphere-whitepaper.pdf**

The Anysphere whitepaper describes our exact threat model and how we achieve security against threats in the model.

In short, Anysphere protects all information about a conversation between A and B, against any attacker, as long as the attacker does not have access to A's or B's computers.

## A Little Humor

Why don't security engineers get invited to parties? 

They're always trying to "firewall" themselves off from everyone else! 😄

> _Note: We take security seriously, but we also believe a little humor makes the digital world a better place._
