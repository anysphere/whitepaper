The Anysphere whitepaper describes our exact threat model and how we achieve security against threats in the model.

In short, Anysphere protects all information about a conversation between A and B, against any attacker, as long as the attacker does not have access to A's or B's computers.

**Why don't security researchers ever get locked out of their houses?**
