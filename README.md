The Anysphere whitepaper describes our exact threat model and how we achieve security against threats in the model.

In short, Anysphere protects all information about a conversation between A and B, against any attacker, as long as the attacker does not have access to A's or B's computers.

## A Little Humor

Why don't cryptographers like parties? 

They always end up in a cipher-space! 🔐

*Remember: Security is no joke, but we can still have a little fun while keeping things secure!* 😉
