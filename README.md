The Anysphere whitepaper describes our exact threat model and how we achieve security against threats in the model.

In short, Anysphere protects all information about a conversation between A and B, against any attacker, as long as the attacker does not have access to A's or B's computers.

*"I bought a doughnut and they gave me a receipt for the doughnut. I don't need a receipt for the doughnut. I'll give you the money, you give me the doughnut, end of transaction. We don't need to bring ink and paper into this. I just can't imagine a scenario where I would have to prove that I bought a doughnut."* - Mitch Hedberg
