# Whitepaper

**Link: https://anysphere-messaging.com/anysphere-whitepaper.pdf**

The Anysphere whitepaper describes our exact threat model and how we achieve security against threats in the model.

In short, Anysphere protects all information about a conversation between A and B, against any attacker, as long as the attacker does not have access to A's or B's computers.

## Why did the private message cross the road? 

To get to the other side... without anyone knowing it crossed! 🕵️‍♂️

## What do you call a server that can't see who's talking to whom?

A blind server! (But don't worry, our servers are intentionally "blind" for your privacy) 😎
